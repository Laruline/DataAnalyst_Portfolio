# Lauréline Colliard - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Lauréline! With a background in 3D animation and technical rigging, I've always been passionate about problem-solving and technology. Now, I'm diving into the world of data analytics, bringing a creative and structured approach to data. I leverage my knowledge of visual storytelling and technical rigor to turn complex data into actionable insights. Whether it's building dashboards or predictive models, I'm dedicated to helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

On this journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation in data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning. My projects showcase my skills in transforming raw data into powerful visualizations and predictive insights that drive real-world business outcomes.

Check out my portfolio and get in touch to collaborate on future projects!

## Projects
Here are some selected data analytics projects, along with the tools and methods used to achieve insights.


### Project 1 - US Bank Loan Analysis and Dashboard Creation 
![Alt text](https://github.com/Laruline/2024_US_Bank_Loan_Analysis_PowerBI_SQLServer/blob/main/DashboardPresentation.JPG)
- **Project Details and Code**: [https://github.com/Laruline/2024_US_Bank_Loan_Analysis_PowerBI_SQLServer](https://github.com/Laruline/2024_US_Bank_Loan_Analysis_PowerBI_SQLServer/tree/main)
- **Goal**: Provide a detailed and comprehensive dahsboard for accessing vital loan data and monitor trends and risks.     
- **Description**: The project steps include: database creation, data loading, DQL, CTE,  queries documentation for safeproofing, Power BI connection, data cleaning, data modeling, data processing, power queries using DAX, visual creations and dashboard creation.
- **Skills**: DQL (Data Query Language), CTE, Power queries, DAX, data cleaning, data modeling, data processing, data visualizations and dashboard creation.
- **Technology**: SQL Server, Power BI. 
- **Results**: A user-friendly, comprehensive three-part dashbord showcasing the entire bank loan data. Easily navigated using custom page navigation menu.



### Project 2 - Loan Acceptance Prediction Model

- **Project details and Code**: https://github.com/Laruline/2024_Loan_Acceptance_Prediction_ML/tree/main
- **Goal**: Use machine-learning to predict loan acceptance for a bank.
- **Description**: The dataset contains 13 columns of public data about loans details and status. The project steps include: API connection to kaggle, jupyter notebook connection, data cleaning, data pre-processing, data visualization, Train-Test Split, model and fitting, testing (accuracy, precision, recall, f1), fine-tuning.
- **Skills**: Data cleaning, data pre-processing, data visualization, machine learning.
- **Technology**: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Missingo, Scikit-Learn, Random Forest, GridSearchCV, Feature Importance.
- **Results**: Approved loans are predicted at 92%, while rejected loans are predicted at 72%. A high recall has been favoured here to avoid losing potential "good" clients with a risk of having a few "bad" clients being approved instead of rejected. the fine-tuning is subjective and highly dependant on business' requieries and wishes.



### Project 3 - F1 Safety Regulations And Performance 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3060a5d0-395e-41fd-959e-a171dbafc5b2)
- **Project Details and Code**: (https://github.com/Laruline/2024_F1_SafetyRegulations_Jupyter_Pandas/tree/main)
- **Goal**: Provide a detailed analysis of F1 new regulations impact on safety and car performance over the years from 1990 to 2023.
- **Description**: The dataset contains 10 columns of public sensitive data about F1 car performance and regulations from 1990 to 2023. The project steps include: API connection to kaggle, jupyter notebook connection, data modeling, data analysis, data visualization.
- **Skills**: Data cleaning, data modeling, data processing, data visualizations.
- **Technology**: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Results**: New regulations on aerodynamics are the most dangerous, mostly likely to change of behaviour on the car and unexpected side-effects. As such, 100% of fatalities happened on a year with new aerodynamics regulations, even though these changes only account for 44% of new regulations. However, new regulations in general seem to have greatly improved the risk of fatal accidents and with fatalities diminishing steadily over the years and plateauing at 0 for the past 7 years. New regulations on aerodynamics don't seem to have improved car performance before the arrival of DRS, and the continuous increase in car weight  was slowly impacting performance negatively as well. The arrival of DRS transformed the cars' ability to overtake, which averages at 110% more than before DRS. It helped counter the increase in weight. Recent efforts in aerodynamics regulation seem to have taken advantage of DRS and increasing car weight while keeping fatalities at bay, showcasing rapidly increasing ability to overtake.
